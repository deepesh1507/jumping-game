### **Jumping Game**

The Jumping Game is a simple and fun web-based game developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. In this game, the player controls a character that must jump over obstacles to avoid collision. The longer the player survives without hitting an obstacle, the higher the score. It's a test of reflexes and timing, making it engaging for players of all ages.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Player Control:** The player can make the character jump by pressing a key (usually the spacebar or a specific button on the screen).
  
- **Obstacles:** Randomly generated obstacles appear on the screen, moving towards the character at increasing speeds as the game progresses.
  
- **Jump Mechanics:** The character performs a smooth jump to avoid obstacles. If the character collides with an obstacle, the game is over.
  
- **Scoring System:** The score increases as the player survives longer, and the score resets when the game is restarted after a collision.

- **Responsive Design:** The game works across various devices and screen sizes, thanks to CSS for the layout and animation.

#### **Technologies Used:**

- **JavaScript:** Handles the game logic, including player controls, obstacle generation, collision detection, and score updates.
  
- **CSS:** Manages the styling of the game, including the layout, the design of the character, the obstacles, and animations such as the jump and obstacle movement.
  
- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the game, including the canvas or divs where the game elements are rendered.

This jumping game is a great introduction to game development with web technologies, blending animation, user interaction, and game mechanics in an exciting way.
